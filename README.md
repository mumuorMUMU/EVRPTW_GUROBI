This is a reproduction of the EVRPTW mathematical model in the paper The Electric Vehicle-Routing Problem with Time
Windows and Recharging Stations. <https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2013.0490>, which includes the setting of virtual nodes mentioned in the original text, and the solution results of all computing power are consistent with those in the paper. 
It is worth noting that the two-stage optimization mentioned by the original author is achieved here by setting penalties for the number of vehicles.
